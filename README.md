# Pokédex - React

A simple web application built with CSS, and React that loads Pokémon data from an external RESTful API.

Project: [Pokédex](https://aakeohane.github.io/React-Pokedex/)

I built this project to relearn react using functional components, I was traditionally taught with class components. I made use of useEffect and useState hooks to fetch data from the pokemon API and render a list of pokemon and their sprites. I organized my code in a way that made sense to me at the time where most of the main functions live on the parent App.js component.
